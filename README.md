ML-CA-1: Vehicle Crash Victim Injury Severity Prediction
This repository contains the code and an exploratory data analysis (EDA) report for a machine learning project focused on predicting the severity of injuries sustained by individuals involved in vehicle crashes. The project utilizes a dataset of over 50,000 records to build a predictive model that can be valuable for traffic safety policy, insurance risk assessment, and smart car safety system development.

üéØ Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a classification model that can predict the Injury Severity of a crash victim based on various factors. This is a crucial step towards understanding the conditions that lead to severe injuries and can inform data-driven decisions in road safety.
üöÄ Use Case
The predictive model developed in this project can support:
‚Ä¢	Policy Formulation: Identifying which conditions are most associated with severe injuries to guide road safety policies.
‚Ä¢	Insurance Risk Assessment: Providing a data-backed approach for assessing risk factors in crash scenarios.
‚Ä¢	Smart Car Safety Systems: Informing the development of future safety systems in vehicles to better protect occupants.
üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA was conducted to understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and prepare the data for modeling. Key findings from the EDA include:
‚Ä¢	Dataset Size: The raw dataset contains 50,000 records and 15 columns.
‚Ä¢	Missing Values: Significant missing data was observed in columns such as License State Code, Transported By, and Safety Equipment. For this analysis, rows with missing values were removed, resulting in a cleaned dataset with 32,858 rows.
‚Ä¢	Data Distribution:
o	The Year column is heavily skewed towards 2019, indicating that the majority of the data is from that year.
o	The Age distribution is slightly right-skewed, with the majority of victims falling between 20 and 60 years old.
o	Role Type and Victim Status show a high frequency for "Driver" and "Not Applicable" respectively, which may require careful handling during feature engineering.
‚Ä¢	Feature Correlation: A strong positive correlation (0.94) was found between Year and Case Vehicle ID, suggesting multicollinearity. This is an important consideration for model selection.
ü§ñ Machine Learning Plan
Given that the target column Injury Severity is categorical, this is a classification problem. The following machine learning algorithms are planned for application:
‚Ä¢	Logistic Regression
‚Ä¢	Decision Tree Classifier
‚Ä¢	Random Forest Classifier
‚Ä¢	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
‚Ä¢	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
